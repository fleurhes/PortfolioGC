## Description  
The cosmos have been a long-standing fascination of mine, resulting in my passion for astrophotography. Although I enjoy astrophotography, it is challenging—especially following my most recent knee surgery—to set up my equipment and get the perfect shot. In order for me to experience the cosmos inside, I began to look into ways to leverage generative art through the use of p5.js and further explore through the magic of math.  

## Results  
Through the use of trigonometry, geometric vectors, and statistical probability, I simulate a nebula featuring layers of color for realistic shading, a dynamic starfield utilizing probability to determine distribution and flickering, as well as fractal noise created with geometric vectors to smooth the generated images.  

This project is meant to be viewed through a lens of creative possibility through code and a potential way to bridge the gap between arithmetic and visual-based learning.
